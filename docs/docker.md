### Day 0 – Docker Basics
- Docker is a containerization tool that packages applications with dependencies.
- Core concepts include images, containers, and Dockerfiles.

## Day 1 – Docker Architecture
- Client–daemon model
- Docker daemon manages containers
- Docker client issues commands
- Images stored in registries
- Docker Hub is default

## Day 2 – Docker Installation
- Native on Linux
- Uses VM on Windows/macOS
- docker --version verifies install
- hello-world validates setup
- Docker Desktop manages resources

## Day 3 – Docker Images
- Read-only templates
- Built in layers
- Cached for performance
- Smaller images are faster
- docker images lists them
